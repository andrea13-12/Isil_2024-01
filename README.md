# Intro to Programming

Welcome to my Intro to Programming repository! This repository contains the code and documentation for my work completed during the 2024-1 semester at ISIL.

## Overview

- Instructor: Alfredo Pardon La Rosa

- Semester: 2024-1

## Description

This course focuses on developing logical, analytical, and design skills necessary for solving programming problems using algorithms and modular programming techniques. It covers foundational topics such as programming fundamentals, conditional structures, repetitive structures, methods, and arrays. The course is designed to build proficiency in creating simple, precise, and organized code applicable in various programming languages.

## Key Topics:

- Programming Fundamentals: Introduction to programming languages, variable handling, and basic program creation.

- Conditional Structures: Logic-based decision-making using simple and nested conditions.

- Repetitive Structures: Iterative processes through loops and their implementation in problem-solving.

- Methods and Arrays: Organizing code with methods and managing data using arrays.

## Methodology: 
The course employs adaptive learning, problem-based learning, and project-based learning strategies, fostering an interactive and hands-on approach to mastering programming concepts.

## Evaluation: 
Continuous assessment through assignments and practical evaluations, along with a midterm and final exam, ensures a comprehensive understanding of the material.
